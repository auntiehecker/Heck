 # Auntie Hecker Threat Intel

This repository documents a personal digital forensics investigation into persistent malware, unauthorized network access, and infrastructure abuse. The goal is to publicly archive and analyze indicators of compromise (IOCs), relevant domains, hashes, and IPs found through tools like SpiderFoot and manual inspection.

## Contents

- `auntie-hecker-IOCs.csv`: Confirmed IOCs including suspicious IP addresses, domains, and file hashes.
- `Scans/`: Place for SpiderFoot scans or any structured threat intel.
- `Notes/`: Textual breakdowns, timelines, or observed behavior.
- `README.md`: This document.

## Purpose

- Highlight abuse of common infrastructure (e.g., Google APIs, cookie consent CDNs, domain registrars like Tucows).
- Share public threat intelligence and indicators for community analysis.
- Crowdsource insights into ongoing surveillance and compromise techniques.
